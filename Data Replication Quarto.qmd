## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(usethis)
library(lmodel2)
library(skimr)
library(latticeExtra)
library(broom)
library(sjPlot)
library(mosaic)
library(manipulate)
library(patchwork)
library(infer)
f <-
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
