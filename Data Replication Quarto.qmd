## Intro and Background

This paper, *Predictable Evolution Towards Larger Brains in Birds Colonizing Oceanic Islands*, sought to observe whether birds who live on islands have larger brains sizes compared to their continental counterparts, and to explore potential explanatory variables that influence that trend. Written by Ferran Sayol and co., the paper was published in 2018 in Nature Communications. The basis of this paper is that island birds face greater evolutionary pressure than mainland species. This pressure encourages evolutionary changes which confer benefit to adaptability, and is why it is hypothesized islandic birds have larger brain sizes to allow for short-term changes in behaivor. The paper uses data of brain samples from museum collections of bird skulls, of which a total of 11,554 specimens were obtained representing 1,931 different species. The differences were explored using Bayesian Phylogenetic Mixed Models (BPMM) which is a model that stratifies evolutionary patterns by phylogeny. When considering migratory pattern, body size, and developmental mode as factors, the study found significant differences in islandic birds to their mainland counterparts, with island birds having significantly larger brains.

A key limiter in data replication is the nuance and background needed to successfully create, run, and interpret BPMM. This complex model requires a deep understanding of its inputs, as well as the phylogenetics which go in to it. As a liver disease researcher, neither of these are within my perview, however linear mixed models are experiments I can replicate.

The following section follows the initial data exploration performed to understand the characteristics of the data. The data set contains several data columns, but the variables of interest are taxonomic order, family, brain size, brain residual (phylogeny adjusted difference in brain size), body weight, and insularity (a categorical variable, either Insular (island dwelling) or Continental (mainland dwelling).

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(usethis)
library(lmodel2)
library(skimr)
library(latticeExtra)

```

```{R}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheCoolestPotato/Data-Replication-Assignment/refs/heads/main/41467_2018_5280_MOESM4_ESM.csv"
d <- read.csv(f)
d <- d |> select(Taxonomic.Order, Family, Insularity, N, Brain..mm3., Body..g., Brain.Residual)
skim(d)
##This section runs basic exploratory data visualization across the pertinent variables. This finds that there are no missing or N/A values in the data set, the collection contains 44 unique taxonomic orders across 178 families, the mean brain size for all observations is 4.38 mm3,and the mean body weight of all observations is  1867 grams.

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
